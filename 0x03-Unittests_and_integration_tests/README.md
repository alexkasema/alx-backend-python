# Unittests and Integration Tests
## Unit Testing:
Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual software components are tested. Unit Testing of the software product is carried out during the development of an application. An individual component may be either an individual function or a procedure. Unit Testing is typically performed by the developer. It is a testing method using which every independent module are tested to determine if there is any issue by the developer himself.

## Integration Testing:
Integration testing is the process of testing the interface between two software units or modules. Its focus is on determining the correctness of the interface. Integration testing aims to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units. Once all the modules have been unit tested, integration testing is performed.
