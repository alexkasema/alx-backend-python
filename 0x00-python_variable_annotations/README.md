# Python - Variable Annotations
def moon_weight(earth_weight: float) -> str:
    return f'On the moon, you would weigh {earth_weight * 0.166} kilograms.'```
In Python 3, type annotations do not change this. Python is still a dynamically-typed language. Type annotations serve the following purpose:

Code documentation: thanks to them, a developer reading type-annotated code (his own or someone elseâ€™s) will know exactly what type each variables is supposed to be. This helps reduce bugs and exceptions and accelerate the development cycle.
Linting and validation: code editors and continuous integration (CI) pipelines can be configured to automatically validate type-annotated code at build-time and catch bugs before they make it to production.
## 0-add.py
Write a type-annotated function add that takes a float a and a float b as arguments and returns their sum as a float.
## 1-concat.py
Write a type-annotated function concat that takes a string str1 and a string str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string.
